<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#ffffff; padding: 1em;">My favorite women in tech is Sheryl Sandberg. She is a top executive of Facebook, one of the top 5 most valuable brands. She breaks stereotypes as her net value in $1.4 million dollars. She serves as an excellent example of the potential of women and the opprotunties coding can give you. Her courage and intelligence serves as an inspiration to me, as she empowers women everywhere. </p>
<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#ffffff; padding: 1em;">Other girls should for sure join. Coding gives you an opprotunities to break stereotypes and be a powerful woman. Every girl has a beautiful heart and brillant mind. Every girl deserves to be heard, and be seen. Be that girl to make a difference. <p>
<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#ffffff; padding: 1em;">I am more than just a coder. I am a student, friend and sports fanatic. I play swimming, tennis and soccer. I love to be with my family and drink Starbucks and shop with my friends. I am also a foodie: I love aestheic yogurt parfaits, crumbly croissants, and classic vanilla ice cream.
